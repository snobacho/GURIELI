            From the beginning it was back in 1809, two-hundred years ago,
            Prince Mamia V Gurieli (1809-1826), last ruler of Guria
            principality in Western Georgia, took great interest in 

            transforming and developing the agricultural sector.  
            <span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px;"></span>
            Following the advice given by the French botanists Andre 
            Michaux and his son Francois Andre Michaux, who were the first to bring the tea 
            plant to the United States in 1799, the Prince ordered the first Tea - Camellia
            Sinensis samples. These were brought to his botanical garden by the Scotsman Jacob 
            Montague Marr, together with other exotic plants. Cultivation of this once unknown plant has
            laid the grounds for the development of what in the following decades became one of the biggest 
            agricultural industries in Georgia.

            1861 the first Georgian “Baikhi” tea was produced on
            an industrial scale. After exhibiting the product on 
            agricultural exposition, Georgian tea gained acknowledgement.
            Starting from 1885 Georgian tea could be found in shops across the Europe. In 1899
            Georgian tea was awarded golden medal at Paris International Exhibition. 
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px;"></span>
            1900s tea producing companies started emerging, more and 
            more tea plantations were cultivated and new processing 
            factories were built. The Georgian tea industry saw rapid and remarkable growth. 
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px;"></span>
            In 1980’s the Georgian tea industry engaged 190 000 employees,
            owned more than 70 thousand ha of tea plantations, 140 primary production, 25
            tea packing, 3 mechanical factories and a number of industrial units.

                Georgia produced 600 thousand tons of green leaves or 133 thousand tons of tea becoming the fifth largest
                producer in the world after India, China, Japan and Sri-Lanka. <br><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px;"></span>
                Geographic location, climatic conditions, temperatures that vary drastically between summer and winter,
                determine the unique character of Georgian tea. Due to the natural factors, it is not necessary the use of
                pesticides and herbicides, therefore our tea is ecologically pure and the environment is less polluted.

            The number of sunny days in Georgia, optimal average annual temperature (+12.5 C ..+14.7 C) and subtropical 
            climate contribute to the quality of tea leaves. Strong contrast between day and nighttime temperatures during 
            the period when the tea shoots start to appear, produces aromatic substances 
            in the delicate sprouts of the plant creating a complex bouquet of aroma unique to Georgian tea.
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px;"></span>
            It is noteworthy that Georgia has played an essential role in the study of tea cultivation worldwide.
            Georgian scientist, Ksenia Bakhtadze first proved the principle that different varieties of tea could be 
            crossed to create plants with unique traits. Through the generational selection method, she managed to
            make over 16 hybrid varieties characterized by high frost-resistance and economic efficiency.

            The idea of Gurieli was born in 2008. And in 2010 the first packs of packed, branded Gurieli, made of premium 
            quality green tea leaves could be found in all shops across Georgia.
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px;"></span>
            Since then we have been working on development and perfection of this umbrella brand. Each day, step by step,
            full of passion we strive towards our mission: To provide the healthiest 
            drink of the millennium to the world from the finest, environmentally-friendly, best tea plantations of rural Georgia.
